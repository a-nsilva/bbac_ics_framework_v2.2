# BBAC Framework - Decision Thresholds
# Risk-based decision boundaries and trust filters

thresholds:
  # Authentication
  max_auth_attempts: 3               # Maximum authentication attempts before lockout
  
  # Trust filter (continuous learning)
  trust_threshold: 0.8               # Minimum trust score to update profiles
  min_confidence_for_update: 0.7     # Minimum decision confidence for updates
  require_grant_for_update: true     # Only update on grant decisions
  
  # Decision boundaries (graduated response)
  # High score = normal behavior = low risk
  t1_allow: 0.7        # Above T1: Grant access (low risk)
  t2_mfa: 0.5          # T2-T1: Require MFA (medium risk)
  t3_review: 0.3       # T3-T2: Manual review (high risk)
  # Below T3: Deny (critical risk)
